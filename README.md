# ClimaSense

Welcome to the ClimaSense! This is a simple and intuitive web application that provides real-time weather information based on your current location or any manually searched location. The app is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (for chatbot functionality), and the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- **Automatic Location Detection:** The app requests access to your current location and automatically displays the weather information for that location.
- **Manual Search:** If you want to check the weather for a different location, simply enter the city name in the search bar.
- **Real-Time Data:** The app fetches up-to-date weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, ensuring you get the latest information.
- **Chatbot:** The app includes a chatbot called Weather Bot, built using Python frameworks like Streamlit and SpaCy. Weather Bot responds to user queries about weather conditions in specific locations and displays real-time information directly in the app.
